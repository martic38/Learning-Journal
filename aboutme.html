                <p class="blog-content">After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, 
                    I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo 
                    Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.</p>

            <h3>How I stay commited to learning</h3>
            <p class="blog-content">I currently work in construction and I hate it. 
                    This has been the biggest motivator to keep learning every day. 
                    Through daily learning I have grown to love it. 
                    It's a spark that I had lost during my university degree and it's back.</p>
            <p class="blog-content">While that is great, I felt it would be helpful
                     to share what I was learning and maybe inspire someone 
                    else in my position to do so too.</p>
            <h3>How I got started</h3>
            <p class="blog-content">
                I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. 
                    I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, 
                    I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short 
                    summaries of what I learned using my own words.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-content">    
                    That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my 
                    learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
